> A _Better_ Sonarr/Radarr Request Bot for Discord

## Why not [Requestrr](https://github.com/darkalfx/requestrr)

- Uses modern Discord slash commands and components, which provides a clean, performant UI on desktop and mobile
- Simple codebase, <1k lines of code versus almost 10k lines of C# and 7k lines of JS
- Simple configuration, no need to have a whole web frontend
- Powered by Clojure and [Discljord](https://github.com/IGJoshua/discljord), a markedly better language ðŸ˜›

### Shortcomings

I wanted a clean app for the sole purpose of requsting movies/TV shows.
I personally didn't need Siri, Overseerr, or Ombi integration - so those are missing in this bot.
If enough people would like to see those features, please request it.
As such, there is only a boolean permission (role gated) for who has access to the bot, nothing fancy.

## Setup

### Discord

1. Create a new [Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in Discord
2. Go to the Bot tab and add a new bot
3. Copy out the token
4. Go to OAuth2 and under "OAuth2 URL Generator", enable `applications.commands` and `bot`
5. Copy the resulting URL and use as the invite link to your server

In the server for which you will use the bot, you need to create a new role for
your users. Then, grab that role id.

To do this:

1. Enable Developer Mode (User Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode)
2. Under your server settings, go to Roles, find the role and "Copy ID"

### Sonarr/Radarr

1. Copy out your API keys from Settings -> General

## Running with Docker

Simply run with

```bash
docker run \
-e SONARR_URL='http://localhost:8989' \
-e RADARR_URL='http://localhost:7878' \
-e SONARR_API='sonarr_api' \
-e RADARR_API='radarr_api' \
-e MAX_RESULTS=10 \
-e BOT_TOKEN='bot_token' \
-e ROLE_ID='role_id' \
--name doplarr ghcr.io/kiranshila/doplarr:main

```

## Building and Running Locally

You need the Clojure CLI tools to build

1. Clone directory
2. `clj -T:build uberjar`

### Configuring

1. Fill out `config.edn` with the requisite things

### Setting up as a service (On Linux (Systemd))

1. Create the file /etc/systemd/system/doplarr.service with the following

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Doplarr Daemon
After=syslog.target network.target
[Service]
User=root
Group=root
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/Doplarr
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar target/Doplarr.jar -Dconfig=config.edn
TimeoutStopSec=20
KillMode=process
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

2. Customize the user, group, and working directory to the location of the jar

Then, as root

3. `systemctl -q daemon-reload`
4. `systemctl enable --now -q doplarr`
